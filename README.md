## 🧩 What is a Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. Each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of **3**:
- `A → D`
- `B → E`
- `HELLO → KHOOR`

Decryption reverses this process.
